This vegetation type can originate from small-scale disturbances such as landslides, windfall and localized fires or can represent a topo-edaphic climax especially at higher elevations and on exposed rocky sites.  Most examples of this shrubland are at least 100 years old.",,,,,,,SE Forest,CWD residual,Temperate residual,SE Forest,Shrublands
